# Bixi Telemetry Data Warehouse
### Data Engineering Capstone Project

#### Project Summary
The goal of this project is to build a data warehouse for Bixi, a Montreal-based bike-sharing service. The modeled data will then be used to analyze ride pattern and availability of bikes at every station, enabling Bixi to optimize replenishment activities.

### How to Run 
All pipeline execution steps are contained within the `capstone-project.ipynb` notebook. The AWS IAM and Redshit cluster configs should be populated in the `dwh.cfg` file prior to running.
